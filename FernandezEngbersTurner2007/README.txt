code to run the five equation PC in

Fernandez, F. R., Engbers, J. D., & Turner, R. W. (2007). Firing
dynamics of cerebellar purkinje cells. Journal of neurophysiology,
98(1), 278-294.

I guessed the units for R (kOhm), since it wasn't given and the slow
potassium has a different conductance to the one given in the paper.

In so far as is possible this code is placed in the public domain.
